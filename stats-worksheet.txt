10. Normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, 
    showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. 
    In graph form, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.

11. Missind data can be handled by:
  - by replacing the nan with the mean of the column data if it is a continuous data. 
  - by replacing the nan with the mode of the column data if it has categorical data.

   Imputation techniques: 
   - Average imputation
   - Common-point imputation
  
12. A/B Testing : A/B testing is basically statistical hypothesis testing also known as statistical inference. 
    It is an analytical method for making decisions that estimates parameters/result based on sample statistics.
  
   There are 2 types of hypnothesis:
   - Null hypothesis - choose the default outcome or sitaution as it is in present. i.e. the status quo.
   - Alternative hypothesis - challenges the status quo amd make assumptions.

   There are 2 type of erros in A/B testing:
   - Type 1: Occurs when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is actually a difference 
             between the original result and the variation when there really isnâ€™t.
   - Type 2: Occurs when we conclude test with the assumption that none of the variations beat the original result while in reality one of them did beat the original result.

13. Mean imputation of missing data is not an acceptable practice in every scenario. missing data values are based on the type of 
    the data present in the specific feature/column.

14. There are two branches of Statistics:
    - Descriptive Statistics: It is a branch of statistics that focuses on collecting, summarizing, and presenting a set of data.
    - Inferential Statistics: IT involves drawing the right conclusions from the statistical analysis that has been performed using descriptive statistics.
